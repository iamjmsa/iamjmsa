### Hi, I'm Jomer San Andres ðŸ’»
**Freelance Web Developer** based in **Manila, Philippines**

I work on projects including websites, web design and web apps. I've helped small and medium-sized businesses and organizations to grow, improve their online presence, and scale their operations through software solutions.

I collaborate with my **teammates** to create our client's websites. When I'm not writing code, I enjoy reading and learning about self-development and financial literacy.
